              presentingperl intends to allow authors to provide additional HTML containing a description of their talk or links to slides.
              There will soon be a form to help automate the process of uploading custom
              html on this page. Until we get that live, if you're the author of this talk (or just happen to have collected links to slides and similar for us) please send the html you wish
              to appear to 
              <a href="mailto:m.keating@shadowcat.co.uk">m.keating(at)shadowcat.co.uk</a>
              for inclusion.
