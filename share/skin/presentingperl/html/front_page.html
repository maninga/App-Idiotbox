            <p>
            This website is a resource location for talks and presentations on, or about, 
            the Perl language. We have videos from conferences and workshops but it is our 
            aim to provide a single location for all Perl audio/visual resources and 
            material. We hope to incorporate other multimedia properties and custom HTML 
            from the authors/presenters and have provided a link to submit material. 
            The site is built and maintained by Shadowcat Systems Limited. Presenting Perl 
            is powered by Idiot Box which is built using the Web::Simple framework.
